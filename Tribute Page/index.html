                Tesla's fascination with electricity and its potential for the betterment of humanity led him to work tirelessly on various projects. One of his most ambitious ideas was to provide free and wireless energy to the entire world. He envisioned a global network of Wardenclyffe Towers, capable of transmitting electricity wirelessly over vast distances. Unfortunately, due to financial constraints and skepticism from investors, the project never reached its full potential, and the Wardenclyffe Tower was ultimately abandoned. Nonetheless, Tesla's vision for wireless power transmission laid the groundwork for future technological advancements in wireless communication and energy transmission.
